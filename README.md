This is a fork of https://github.com/andmott/MountTooltip (and https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mount-tooltip) to update and maintain it for Midnight with the sweeping API changes.

Midnight Mount Tooltip attempts to add the mount name, logo, and collected/not collected status for the mount a player is currently on, to the standard blizzard tooltip for a character when you move your
mouse over that character.

It's protected against triggering in combat as auras are classified as secret in combat and it would error out.

There are no options. There are no expanded features.
Simple.
Clean.
Effective.

It's why I loved the original and wanted it to continue into Midnight and beyond.
